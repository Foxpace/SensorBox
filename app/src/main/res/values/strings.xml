    <string name="settings_activity_recognition_text">SensorBox uses Activity Recognition Client, Google\'s API, which is native tool for
    activity recognition for Android. The client is capable to provide basic information about movement status of a phone,
    whether it is in a vehicle, with a person or stationary placed. \n\nThe client can recognize changes among these activities:\n\n
        \u2022 In vehicle - 0\n
        \u2022 On Bicycle - 1\n
        \u2022 On foot - running/walking - 2\n
        \u2022 Still - device is not moving - 3\n
        \u2022 Walking - 7\n
        \u2022 Running - 8\n\nThese data will be stored in "activity_changes.csv" with a appropriate timestamp in NANOseconds of system time. Numbers beside the activities are used to encode them in csv file. Last column "enter_exit" describes, if the activity was entered (0) or exited (1).\n\nWith the customizable frequency of updates, you can get an actual confidence of each activity in %. This data will
    be stored in "activity_confidence.csv" with timestamps in MILLIseconds - UNIX time. There are also available this activities:\n\n
    \u2022 Tilting - device angle relative to gravity changed significantly - 5\n
    \u2022 Unknown - unable to detect activity - 4\n\nSum of activities do not equal to 100%, because some activities are not exclusive
        (on foot is generalization of walking and running).
        Moreover, the frequency of updates do not need to be precise, due to a battery optimizations of system.
